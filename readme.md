# Sales Data Analysis with Pandas and Seaborn
This was the final project of the Introduction to Python & Apps Course run by [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) in Spring 2023.

## Description
---
**First Part:**

Create a Python program that reads a csv file containing sales data, carry out basic analysis of the data, and write the results of the analysis to a csv file.

**Second Part:**

Extending the project by exploring data visualization libraries (matplotlib and seaborn), and by exploring a different dataset from Kaggle, [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). A log file was also added, where selected data is printed together with a timestamp.
